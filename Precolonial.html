    <h4 align="center">Europeans were motivated to travel to the New World because of the God, Gold, and Glory in which they seeked. Without these essential desires from the Europeans, many believe the determination to colonize and attain freedom would never have been there and America as we see it would not be the same.</h4>

    <h2><i><u>Gold</u></i></h2>
    <p>Expeditions to the New World were also greatly motivated by the potential economic gain that was displayed to the explorers and countries who took part in them. Rumors were heard of the great fortunes that could be hidden beneath the lands in the Americas. Furthermore, European countries already have known the great profit that comes along with developing colonies through its material gain. Essentially, traveling to the New World would become an anticipated get rich quick scheme. Many years later, Jamestown was created by England for the same reason as the expeditions before it. England saw the economical benefits that seeped through the New World and wanted to reap the benefits.</p>

    <h2><i><u>God</u></i></h2>
    <p>With the New World’s popularity steadily growing during the age of exploration, explorers thought God would reward their efforts in spreading their religion to the people of the New World. The European explorers believed they were doing everyone in the New World a favor and doing God’s bidding. Further along the road, during a time of constant religious turmoil, many people in Europe during the sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth centuries were persecuted for their religious beliefs and values. Their tolerance of this lack of religious freedom soon crumbled completely and a new solution for those who were being persecuted arose. Jamestown was then the first foreign settlement into the Americas to be colonized with Plymouth following not long after. Pilgrims fled to Plymouth to be relieved of any religious persecution they had in England.</p>
    
    <h2><i><u>God</u></i></h2>
    <p>Underlying beneath the explorers’ obvious intentions in exploring for wealth and to do God’s work was the feeling of personal gratitude and the desire for fame. The explorers knew that colonization and conquering people were two major steps towards receiving praise from their home countries as well as others while getting a few cities named after them along the way. The power and fame that could have be attained was perfectly enough reasoning for many of the explorers during the age of exploration to take part in expeditions. Nations as a whole also wanted more colonies the glory that coexists with it. England, with much experience in conquering lands, could not take their hands off an opportunity that was in the New World for more land to add to their empire.</p>
